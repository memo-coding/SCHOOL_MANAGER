- student_code (unique)
- class_id (reference to Class)
- parent_info: father{}, mother{}, guardian{}
- academic_status: active/transferred/graduated/suspended
- fee_status: paid/pending/overdue/partial

### 3. Teacher

## Database Relationships:
- Student ↔ User (one-to-one)
- Teacher ↔ User (one-to-one)
- Class ↔ Student (one-to-many)
- Class ↔ ClassSubject (one-to-many)
- Subject ↔ ClassSubject (one-to-many)
- Student ↔ Absence (one-to-many)
- Student ↔ Fee (one-to-many)

## Required APIs:
